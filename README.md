##Levels & Ranks

GameBot offers both Ranks and Levels as it's progress means. Ranks or Levels, it's hard to choose so why not be able to use both? Ranks can have levels so you get the best of both worlds. Having issues making balanced xp for your Ranks or levels? GameBot has xp calculators, some of which are directly from your favorite RPGS, to help you. If that wasn't enough a rank or level can hold unlocks or even badges to give more incentive to your users to keep progressing. If you enable skill trees your ranks or levels can hand out skill points to be used to unlock skills.

##Stats & Buffs/Debuffs
Everything has stats(outside of the things stats wouldn't make sense on), power ups on the way. Stats make your users awesome. They represent a means to create competion to reach the top of the stats. Buffs/Debuff allow your users to get an increase to a stat outside of leveling to gain an advantage over everyone else. You can use a percent of a standard number to increase or decrease a stats value. Wait I said stats are everywhere(almost) so you can give that item stats and have them modify another stat at the same time. Create status effects like being poisoned or on fire for a time duraction. This is a base for skill trees, which makes them awesome.

##Skill Trees
A timeless feature in all the cool games. This hallmark allows your users to gain skills, unlocks, and badges. Skill trees are currently in-progress but once finished you'll be able to create several types of skill trees based on tree templates

##Mission & Jobs
Get your users involved with site created misions and user requested jobs. Want to give your users a way to gain xp? Sure you do and missions and jobs is but one way to get'er done.
