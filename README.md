##Levels & Ranks

GameBot offers both Ranks and Levels as it's progress means. Ranks or Levels, it's hard to choose so why not be able to use both? Ranks can have levels so you get the best of both worlds. Having issues making balanced xp for your Ranks or levels? GameBot has xp calculators, some of which are directly from your favorite RPGS, to help you. If that wasn't enough a rank or level can hold unlocks or even badges to give more incentive to your users to keep progressing. If you enable skill trees your ranks or levels can hand out skill points to be used to unlock skills.

##Stats & Buffs/Debuffs
Everything has stats(outside of the things stats wouldn't make sense on), power ups on the way. Stats make your users awesome. They represent a means to create competion to reach the top of the stats. Buffs/Debuff allow your users to get an increase to a stat outside of leveling to gain an advantage over everyone else. You can use a percent of a standard number to increase or decrease a stats value. Wait I said stats are everywhere(almost) so you can give that item stats and have them modify another stat at the same time. Create status effects like being poisoned or on fire for a time duraction. This is a base for skill trees, which makes them awesome.

##Skill Trees
A timeless feature in all the cool games. This hallmark allows your users to gain skills, unlocks, and badges. Skill trees are currently in-progress but once finished you'll be able to create several types of skill trees based on tree templates

##Missions & Jobs
Get your users involved with your site by creating misions and user requested jobs. Want to give your users a way to gain xp? Sure you do and missions and jobs is but one way to get'er done. Missions can if it's enabled give money, xp, items, unlocks, and even badges. Missions can be automated or require approval before the rewards are given. You can even put hits out on your enemies to create a wanted list

##Currency & Banking
No game would be complete without currency. Let your users have money to be able to buy items, get money back on trades in shops, and help a friend who needs a couple bucks. Give loans, have a site owned bank or let users own them.

##Shops
Shops are planned to be user or site owned. Collect taxes, sell items or even real goods for site currency. Accept trades for xp(site only shops) or cash and also get that cool item you wanted but could never order. Owning a shop has it's perks.

##villages, nations, guilds oh my
Allow your users the ability to create villages, organizations, clans, guilds or whatever you decide to and have a vllage with guilds, organizations and even clans. I'm bring a timeline based events system to keep track of the going ons, private thread based forum to have group chats, and restrictions based on clan or village or guild

##Achiements & Leader boards
Offer rewards for certain tasks, missions, levels, or even doing nothing. Show off who is the cock of the walk based on a stat, level, missions completed, badges earned, richiest, game points(badges give them), residency, or most wanted.

## Items & Weapons
Where is my loot? Give items or weapons rarity, allow them to drop from lootable items, give them a status effect, an element, or have it do nothing. Everyone wants the best gear, potions, and magic. Did you get an upgraded weapon? Trade it in to a site owned shop for xp or cash based on it's rarity and set trade value in cash.
